=======

Based on django-twoscoops-project, and the principles of "Getting results the agile way".

This is a non-conventional TO-DO app, where you set 3 goals at the beggining of the day and 3 wins at the end of it.

Also you have 3 goals and wins each week.

The backend uses Django and Django-rest-framework, while the frontend is written in Coffeescript and uses AngularJS framework.
